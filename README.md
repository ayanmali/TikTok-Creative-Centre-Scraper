# TODO
- add in custom session ID to the cookie header (each one expires in 10 days I think?)
    - is the cookie header going to be a problem, and is there a way to bypass it? Maybe see if an incognito browser can send a request without the cookie/session ID?
    - is logging in actually necessary, or can you make the request anonymously and increase the limit parameter and get the same result?

- build functionality for selecting industries

- does timestamp need to be correct for the request to work? Will this get me banned?
